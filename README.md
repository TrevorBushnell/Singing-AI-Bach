# Singing-AI-Bach

This repo contains all aspects of my Honors Senior Thesis project - showing what happens when you attempt to sing AI generated Bach chorales. The repo contains all the resources needed when creating this project, including the following:

* **project-docs:** Files related to overall structure and timeline of the project as well as my synopsis of my project.
* **research-docs:** All the papers and textbooks that I've been reading for research on this project. Papers are sorted by CS papers and Bach papers. 
* **papers:** any final papers that I write for the project. This includes my final academic paper as well as a script and performance booklet that I would use for my final talk.
* **ai-music:** AI generated Bach chorales (including original score) for each Bach chorale that I choose to generate
