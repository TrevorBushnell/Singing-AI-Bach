# Concert Outline Script

## Introduction

### About AI

* Thank you for being here! Such an honor.
* You are here because you are curious - AI has evolved significantly in recent years
  * ChatGPT, AI art, AI video clips from text which look incredibly realistic
* How does music fit into this?
* Music is a unique artistic experience for AI to take over because in order for it to be experienced by humans, humans need to bring the art to life - MIDI can only go so far
* The goal of this project is to showcase where AI music generation still has room to grow to accomodate the human voice
* Chose Bach because he was a very accomplished musician
  * devout Luteran
  * wrote many kinds of music from organ fugues to passions cnatatas for the church service
  * wrote roughly 20 pages of music a day for the span of his lifetime - means we have lots of data that we can work with!
  * also wrote chorales - these are closer to hymns. because of this, they are much more approachable from a singers perspective as the harmonic progression makes more logical sense than something from Bach's larger works like the B Minor Mass or the Magnificat

### How This Game is Going to Work

* You will now here 4 sets of chorales, each with 3 harmonizations
  * 1 real, 2 AI your job choose the real one
* Each of the 4 chorales were chosen for various reasons including
  * how does AI handle part crossings?
  * pick my favorites
  * how does AI handle high tessatura? - mean note
  * how does AI handle minor keys?
* **cadential moment:** where the moments pause and continue, do you hear a difference in how those moments are approached?

## BWV302

* First major realization - AI Bach tends to add rhythm that is more complex than its original harmonization
  * So if you want to find the AI generation, try listening for some increased rhythms!
* DeepBach #1 has some interesting behavior in terms of its cadencing and key
  * My music software THOUGHT this was in b minor whereas the original was in D major
    * this comes from starting on a bmin7 chord
    * however, the half cadences are consistently on f#minor chords which gives it the b-minor feel!
    * the full cadences are still on D major which is interesting!
* DeepBach #2 has a "more D major" feel but some of the half cadences are not consistent
  * additionally, listening to individual lines leads to some crazy chromatisicm in the alto line that is not typical of Bach (constantly toying between Ab, A, Bb, B)

## BWV392 (Nun ruhen alle Walder)

* Now all the woods are sleeping
* Picked for the incredibly high tessatura of the piece for most of the parts - was curious to see if the AI would cause certain parts to completely run away with things
* DeepBach #1 has an uncharacteristic tenor line
  * it starts... reasonable (m1-4)
  * gets a little chromatic (m.5-6)
  * then goes crazy with rhythm and sits much lower in the voice than the original chorale
  * However - the cadential moments are relatively similar!
* DeepBach #2 the give away moment (besides some weird chromaticism in the tenor) is the cadential moment at m.6 - should be a half cadence but it just does a full cadence

## BWV430 (Wenn mein Stundlein vorhanden ist)

* If the hour of my death is at hand



## BWV358 (Jesu Meine Fruede)

* DeepBach #3 has a cadential moment that is a full cadence but should be a half cadence... well its a dVI chord but again gives similar feel to a I chord so it makes it feel like there's no need to go anywhere
  * it also ends in d minor where the original ends in D major
* DeepBach #4 is just a monstrosity because it also ends in d minor with INCREDIBLY WEIRD voicing
  * S, B, A, T (highest singing part to lowest singing part)
* The AI also really liked F triads of various kinds (major, minor, and augmented were used as cadential chords in many places which is uncharacteristic of the original chorale)

## The St. Matthew Passion

* Bach also wrote 2 passions which have the most intense storytelling moments of all time
* Had the idea of seeing what would happen if you only reharmonize certain moments but leave other ones alone, so enjoy these two chorales from the St. Matthew's Passion!
