# A Note About BWV244

BWV244 is *St Matthew's Passion.* While there are chorales scattered throughout the entire oratorio, the goal of the music in this directory is to modify only **parts** of the whole to try and make the AI fit seamlessly into the normal Bach writings using `DeepBach`. The measures where there is AI music is written down here for each of the works (but try to figure it out yourself by taking a look at the sheet music in `.pdf` files before looking!)
