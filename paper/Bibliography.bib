	abstract = {This paper presents “{BachBot}”: an end-to-end automatic composition system for composing and completing music in the style of Bach’s chorales using a deep long short-term memory ({LSTM}) generative model. We propose a new sequential encoding scheme for polyphonic music and a model for both composition and harmonization which can be efﬁciently sampled without expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}). Analysis of the trained model provides evidence of neurons specializing without prior knowledge or explicit supervision to detect common music-theoretic concepts such as tonics, chords, and cadences. To assess {BachBot}’s success, we conducted one of the largest musical discrimination tests on 2336 participants. Among the results, the proportion of responses correctly differentiating {BachBot} from Bach was only 1\% better than random guessing.},

	abstract = {Tonal harmony analysis is a sophisticated task. It combines general knowledge with contextual cues, and it is concerned with faceted and evolving objects such as musical language, execution style and taste. We present {BREVE}, a system for performing a particular kind of harmony analysis, chord recognition: music is encoded as a sequence of sounding events and the system should assing the appropriate chord label to each event. The solution proposed to the problem relies on a conditional model, where domain knowledge is encoded in the form of Boolean features. {BREVE} exploits the recently proposed algorithm {CarpeDiem} to obtain signicant computational gains in solving the optimization problem underlying the classication process. The implemented system has been validated on a corpus of chorales from J.S. Bach: we report and discuss the learnt weights, point out the committed errors, and elaborate on the correlation between errors and growth in the classication times in places where the music is less clearly asserted.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models of music typically break up the task of composition into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. In order to better approximate this process, we train a convolutional neural network to complete partial musical scores, and explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to rewriting. Neither the model nor the generative procedure are tied to a particular causal direction of composition.},

We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. {DeepBach}’s strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the {MuseScore} music editor making the interaction with {DeepBach} easy to use.},

I imagine a reception of the prelude as liturgical musical contemplation and religious experience. I construe Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel's setting of Bach's "Das alte Jahr" in the concluding "Nachspiel" of her piano song cycle, Das Jahr, as suggesting interactions of public and private sonic worlds. I follow potential tonal-harmonic alternatives (after Schoenberg and Berg on the chorale) and implications of staging a motivic parsing through timbre and articulation (after Webern). These differently related interpretive and perceptual contexts shape experience and invoke orientations by which the music-structural aspects of a work can be construed and experienced. Bringing two or more contexts together stimulates new levels and types of connection, just as a melodic pattern continually recalibrates and interacts with potential har monic and contrapuntal orientations. Changing or shifting emphases in one orientation respond to the demands or constraints of another; in particular, I track the tonal potential of interactions of prolongational, associative, or stretto-like musical figurations in the prelude. These "differences" in orientation become creative and expressive of newly available content, multiplying interactions of composition and text, reception and analysis.},
