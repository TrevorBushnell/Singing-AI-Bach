# AI Classical Music: How J.S. Bach AI Music is Not Yet "Singable"
### A Gonzaga Honors Thesis Project

This is the place where I will be writing all of the content for my research related to the singability of AI generated Bach music. 

> My concert showcasing my research and a performance of AI generated Bach music will be on **Friday, March 22nd at 4:10PM in the Recital Hall of the Myrtle Woldson Performing Arts Center at Gonzaga University. You can also watch the concert online HERE (online livestream link to come!)

## Abstract

AI has been a recent development that has created vast changes in various ways, from being your productivity assistant looking up information to generating realistic video clips from text. As AI has become more popular, researchers have decided to try this with music. The goal was to attempt to generate music with AI based on specific musical contexts given by a user such as a melody. The AI would then be able to create a song from that information. While some researchers have been able to create AI models that can trick individuals into thinking that music made by AI was real, the music generated doesn't make sense to a human singer having to perform that music. In my research, I chose 4 Bach chorales and fed them to the model [DeepBach](). I then conducted a choir of undergraduate music majors to learn the challenges that come with performing AI music in its current state.
