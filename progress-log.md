# Progress Log

## April 2023

* Wrote initial documents outlining the project requirements
* Onboarded Dr. Stohlmann as faculty advisor

## June 2023

* Got DeepBach working on my local machine
* Read papers on the inner workings of DeepBach and BachBot

## July 2023

* Got recommended lots of Bach books and papers by Dr. Stohlmann to read up on
* Found a new model - Magenta which is Google's AI Bach chorale generator
  * This is a pain in the REAR to set up

## August 2023

### 7/31 - 8/6

* I realized that I have not been documenting my sources well or even doing my annotated bibliographies, so I now got myself caught up on all of these details with all the sources I have gathered and read so far
* Updated this repository with all the worthwhile information that needs to be present (filling in datasets, research papers, this progress report, updating the README, etc. etc.)
* Listed out all bugs that I am currently working through with the `music21` package. 
* Gathered together every task that is pressing to complete with this project, since my excitement has turned into many great but half-baked ideas that all need to be finished
* Goal is to have all reading finished by the end of August because I hate reading and I will not bring myself to read once the school year starts... let's see if I hold to that goal at all :P
