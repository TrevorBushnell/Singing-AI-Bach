### Looking Forward, Looking Back: Reconsidering the Study of JS Bach's Chorales in the Undergraduate Curriculum

This article's thesis is about how Bach's writing of counterpoint is highly contrary to the rigid ways of teaching counterpoint today. Counterpoint textbooks today provide rigid models for part-writing whereas Bach managed to break many rules and be incredibly lax on his part-writing while still maintaining simple harmonies. For example, Bach would not restrict doubling of root-position triads to only the root - not something typically taught in current undergraduate counterpoint curriculum. 

This article is useful for my research because it gives general highlights as to why Bach was so unique with his compositions. It also gives me evidence to show why musicologists say it is so hard to replicate Bach since his compositions are so unique and do not typically follow the norm.


### A Listening Guide to St. Matthew's Passion

A short article explaining things to listen for in Bach's largest oratorio work - BWV 244 (St. Matthew's Passion). This is not particularly useful for research, but I included here to get more exposure to the music that Bach wrote.
