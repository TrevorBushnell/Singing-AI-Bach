# Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven

The book *Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven* is written by John Eliot Gardiner, who is the founder and director of the Monteverdi Choir and leading contemporary expert on all things Bach. This book details everything about Bach, from him growing up, how he learned music, his musical backgrounds, and (most importantly for my research) his compositional techniques. The five chapters for which Gardiner talks about the composition techniques for Bach and his various works are explained below:
